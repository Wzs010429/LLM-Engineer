# PhD Study Milestones (For PYR, Apr 2026)

I prefer updating this plan every month, make a basic plan for the next month, and ensure enough time to complete all tasks


## Milestone 1 (Basic Knowledge) (In the next 1 month):


### Papers

TODO: A vague outline:

1. Search Related Paper **everyday**, One paper carefully, several papers briefly
2. Take notes and list all the paper names daily no matter how much info I get that day


Some Surveys I want to read carefully：
1. [Autoregressive Models in Vision: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05902)
2. [A Survey on Quality Metrics for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11821)
3. [RenAIssance: A Survey Into AI Text-to-Image Generation in the Era of Large Model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10817489)

With the following methods:
1. take notes whenever I get something interesting or important
2. Dig related paper from this survey and mark them and read them if possible


### Codes

> Quite import to take time for developing ur code skill(especially for myself) not just relying on LLMs 

1. Pytorch Understanding Plan(For modifying model architechture later): see Pytorch Plan.md, update weekly
2. LLM Plan(For Systematic learning of engineering development): see LLM Plan.md, update weekly


### Summary

During this milestone, I can complete/have the ability to do the following things:

1. Understand most of the architechture easily and professional terminology when facing a new paper or some new technology published by someone
2. modify some model architure if needed

## Milestone 2 (TODO):



## Milestone 3 (TODO):



## Existing Problem now! (Update 20250424)

1. No technical accumulation, no experience accumulation (extra cost of study, although I am still working on it the progress is slow) —— working on that
2. Start with very basic knowledge, such as clip (**Code** is somehow more import than theory) —— working on that
3. The limitations of only one person to research (Especially no **PhD** with the same **main** direction as me, to be honest)
